# Decision log

Append-only. One entry per non-obvious choice: date · decision · why · consequence.

### 2026-11-01 · Context lives in `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/context/`
Why: AI sessions start cold; a small, curated map beats re-reading the repo each time.
Consequence: every behaviour change updates `STATUS.md`; structure changes update `PROJECT_MAP.md`.

### 2026-11-01 · Mind map as Mermaid in Markdown
Why: GitHub renders Mermaid natively — free, no tool to install, diffable, lives next to the code.
Consequence: `docs/context/MINDMAP.md` is the mind map; edit it like any other doc.

### 2026-11-01 · Removed the Arbitrage panel until a real spread engine exists
Why: nothing produced arbitrage events, so the UI showed a false "no opportunities" result. A
trading system must not display confidence it doesn't have.
Consequence: re-add in ROADMAP Phase 3, fed by fee- and USD/USDT-aware spread logic.

### (earlier) · Each exchange connects independently, subscriptions queued until open
Why: Delta's flaky handshake was blocking data from the other exchanges (commit `a605ed9`).

### (earlier) · Per-cell pub/sub store instead of React state for prices
Why (inferred from the code): tick-rate updates re-rendering the whole table would be too slow; `LiveMarketDataService` +
hooks re-render only the affected `PriceCell`.
